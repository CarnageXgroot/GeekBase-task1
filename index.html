        <h2>About the Series</h2>
        <p>The Harry Potter series is a fantasy fiction saga written by British author J. K. Rowling. The narrative chronicles the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts
            School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow wizard governance, and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).</p>
        <p>The series consists of seven novels that progressively become darker and more mature as Harry and his friends grow up. The world of Harry Potter was originally conceived by Rowling during a delayed train ride from Manchester to London in 1990.
            The first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was first published on June 26, 1997 by Bloomsbury Publishers in London. The book achieved immense popularity, literary acclaim and commercial success, establishing Rowling as a prominent
            author.
